# Overview

As a software engineer, I created this Hello World program to establish a solid foundation in Python programming and version control workflows. This project represents my first step in building a comprehensive software development portfolio.

This software is a simple Python program that displays "Hello, World!" to the console. While basic in functionality, it demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including proper syntax, output operations, and file organization.

The purpose of creating this software is to practice essential development skills including writing clean code, using version control with Git, publishing to GitHub, and documenting projects professionally. This foundational project will serve as a stepping stone for more complex software development endeavors.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and editing the code. Git was used for version control, allowing me to track changes and collaborate effectively. The project was published to GitHub for public access and portfolio building.

The programming language used for this project is Python 3.x, chosen for its readability, simplicity, and widespread use in software development.
